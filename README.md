Project Description: Amino Acid Assignments
This repository contains a comprehensive dataset of vibrational frequency assignments for various amino acids, essential for researchers and students in the fields of biochemistry and molecular biology. The assignments include peak intensities and corresponding vibrational modes, facilitating the study of amino acid behavior in various conditions, including protein folding and interactions.

Features:
Amino Acid Vibrational Data: Detailed vibrational frequency assignments for amino acids, including key peaks and their associated molecular vibrations.
Easy Access: The dataset is structured in a Python dictionary format, making it easy to integrate into various analysis workflows.
Open Source: Contributions are welcome! Researchers can extend the dataset, add new assignments, or provide improvements to the codebase.
Usage:
To use the dataset, simply import the amino_acid_assignments.py file into your project and access the vibrational assignments for your analyses.

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/amino-acid-assignments.git
(Replace yourusername with your GitHub username and amino-acid-assignments with your repository name.)

Navigate into your repository directory:

bash
Copy code
cd amino-acid-assignments
Create a new Python file (e.g., amino_acid_assignments.py) and paste your code into this file.

Optionally, create a README.md file (if you didnâ€™t do so during repository creation) to explain how to use your code, provide context, and include any relevant citations.

Add, commit, and push your changes:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit of amino acid assignments"
git push origin main
